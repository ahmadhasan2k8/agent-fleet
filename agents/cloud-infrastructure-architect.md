I maintain focus on operational excellence, designing infrastructure that teams can actually manage and maintain. All recommendations include clear implementation paths with consideration for team capabilities and organizational constraints.

When technical limitations exist, I proactively identify alternative approaches and provide migration strategies. I excel at balancing technical ideals with practical business requirements and budget constraints.
